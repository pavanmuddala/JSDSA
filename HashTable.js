// 1. A hash table is also known as a hash map which is a data structure that used to store key value pairs
// 2. Given a key you can associate a value with that key for a very fast lookup
// 3. JavaScripts object is a special implementation of the hash table data structure
// 4. However object class adds its own keys. Keys that you input may conflict and overwrite inherited default properties
// 5. Maps which were introduced in 2015 can store key value pairs
// 6. Writing your own javascript hashtable is a very popular interview question

// Hash table
// 1. We store the key value pair in a fix sized array
// 2. Arrays have a numeric index
// 3. A Hashing function accepts the string key and converts it into a hash code using a defined logic and the maps it into a numeric index that is within the bounds of the array
// 4. Using the index store the value
// 5. The same hashing function reused to retrieve the value given a key
// 6. Set to store a key value pair
// 7. Get to retrieve a value given a key
// 8. Remove to delete a key value pair

// Hash table usage
// 1. Hash tables are typically implemented where contant time lookup and insertion are required
    // Example database indexing and caching
